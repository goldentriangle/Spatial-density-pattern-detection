img.py and img_mark.py are used to transform the original textual dataset into intensity matrix.
the latter also included some annotated mark into the matrix.

To check the anomaly_detection algorithm, run main.m file.
Detailed documentation is inside the source code file anomaly_detection.m

I put a transformed intensity image tile.png under folder ./data.
Other images under ./data are some testing results for image preprocessing operations such as image morphological operators, filters and enhancement, etc.
